/****A Star Algorithm Search***/

This A* Algorithm Search implements a Graph Search and a Tree Search to 
find the most efficient path to take. It also uses 2 different heuristic
definitions for a more accurate analysis.

To Run the program please open command line and make sure you are in
your desktop directory

Please type in "javac main.java" to run the program

If wanting to use random Array generator, simply hit '1' when the program
asks whether you want to generate an array

If wanting to input array, then please input numbers 1 by 1 with no spaces
in between. Please input the numbers 0-8 with no duplicates or out of range
numbers.

If the Array is solvable, the program will find the answer.

If the program is not solvable then the program will return an error 
and ask for a re-submission of numbers.
